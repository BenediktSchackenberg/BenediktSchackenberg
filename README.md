## Hey! 👋

I'm Benedikt — hobby admin, hobby programmer, and full-time nerd from Germany.

SQL Server is my religion. AI is my new toy. Let's roll. 🎲

### 🎯 What I Do

I build stuff that works (mostly). When I'm not configuring servers nobody asked for, I write code that solves problems nobody had yet.

**Current obsession:** Connecting AI agents with real systems — because why just chat with a bot when it can also control your PC?

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

```
C# / .NET 8 / WPF      → When it needs to run on Windows
Python / FastAPI       → When it needs to be fast  
PostgreSQL / SQL Server → Where the data lives
PowerShell             → For the dirty work
```

### 🚀 Projects

**[openclaw-windows-agent](https://github.com/BenediktSchackenberg/openclaw-windows-agent)** — Connects your Windows PC to an OpenClaw Gateway. Lets your AI agent remote control your machine. Sounds dangerous? It is. 😈
