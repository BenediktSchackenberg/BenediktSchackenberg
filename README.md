## Hey! 👋

I'm Benedikt — hobby admin, hobby programmer, and full-time nerd from Germany.

SQL Server is my religion. AI is my new toy. Let's roll. 🎲

### 🎯 What I Do

I build stuff that works (mostly). When I'm not configuring servers nobody asked for, I write code that solves problems nobody had yet.

**Current obsession:** Building open-source tools that make fleet management actually enjoyable.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

```
C# / .NET 8 / WPF      → When it needs to run on Windows
Python / FastAPI       → When it needs to be fast  
TypeScript / Next.js   → When it needs to look good
PostgreSQL / SQL Server → Where the data lives
PowerShell             → For the dirty work
```

### 🚀 Featured Project

**[🐙 Octofleet](https://github.com/BenediktSchackenberg/octofleet)** — Open-source endpoint management for Windows & Linux. Hardware inventory, vulnerability scanning, remote terminal, screen mirroring, and more. Self-hosted, no BS.
